<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The client is the instructor for COMP2005 course at the Computer Science Department,
    Memorial University of Newfoundland</p>
<p>The project description presented by the client is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    The COMP2005 course makes use of a proprietary online quiz application integrated into the
    Brightspace product and supported by Memorial's CITL unit. However, the COMP2005 instructor
    would like to develop his own online quiz program, which could later be extended to
    include software code testing and live classroom quiz features. The initial release of
    this project may be limited to MCQ questions and online asynchronous (i.e. not live
    classroom) quiz.
</blockquote>
<p>Each project team is a group of up to 5 students registered in COMP2005 for the Winter 2019 semester.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>Acceptable sources for requirements gathering include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client interview</li>
    <li>User group dicussion</li>
    <li>User stories</li>
    <li>UML use case analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>In their first assignment, each student is tasked with producing an
    original requirement for this project added to the requirements list in this document.
    Functional requirements should be validated by a use case.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<h4>Requirements list HTML tags and conventions</h4>
<p>HTML tags, attributes, and styles have been defined for the
    Requirements List section of this document as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CSS styling of the requirements list is maintained in the file "requirements.css".
        To change the list appearance, modify the CSS file.</li>
    <li>The <code>rqlist</code> CSS class identifies a
        requirements list <code>&lt;ol class="rqlist"&gt;</code> tag</li>
    <li>The <code>rqitem</code> CSS class identifies a
        requirements item using an <code>&lt;li class="rqitem"&gt;</code> tag</li>
    <li>If the <code>rqitem</code> is a requirements category heading:
        <ul>
            <li>It starts with the category title</li>
            <li>Following the title it contains
                a <code>&lt;ol class="rqlist"&gt;</code> sub-list.</li>
        </ul>

    <li>Otherwise the <code>rqitem</code> is a requirement:
        <ul>
            <li>It has a <code>data-moscow</code>
                attribute identifying its MOSCOW priority class
                <code>&lt;li class="rqitem" data-moscow=m&gt;</code></li>
            <li>The item content starts with a short imperative title in

                a <code>&lt;p class=rqdata&gt;</code> tag</li>
            <li>A requirement validation paragraph element follows the requirement data element.
                This element references the methods and documents used to validate the
                requirements.
                Each requirement should refer to at least one use case or one user story; but may
                have additional sources of validity.
                Explanation of validity and links to other media files such as use case analyses
                should be supplied.
                This paragraph is classed <code>rqvali</code> with
